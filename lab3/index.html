		<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<p>The goal of this lab is to create a file structure and add index.html files for our homepage and lab 3.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Creating the file structure and files went smoothly as they were already provided in our art101 folder. However, we struggled to add a photo to the file. We kept making careless mistakes such as leaving a space where there shouldn't be one, or forgetting to close the tag.</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>Eventually we were able to make our index.html files to show up properly on the document.</p>
