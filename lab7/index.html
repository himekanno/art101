		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The challenge of this lab is to write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Although I was able to get the basic feature of mixing the letters and showing a "new name", I had a really hard time trying to add the bonus features. I tried to look at Wes' page for some insight, but it was a bunch of code that I could not really understand.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
