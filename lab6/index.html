		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The challenge of this lab is to figure out how to work with Javascript arrays and objects.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I had no issue with the myTransport array, but I struggled a bit with the myMainRide object. At first when I tried to print myMainRide in the JavaScript console, it would show up as "My Main Ride: [object,object]". That problem was fixed when I replaced the + with a comma. I also could not figure out how to enter the age as a number while also adding "years" at the end, so I had to just enter the whole thing as a string.</p>
