		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The Challenge of this lab is to experiment with JavaScript events.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I did not have many problems completing this lab, because I followed along in class when we did something similar. I had an issue where my form field would not show up, but I realized I was missing a closing tag.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<input type="text" id="user-name"><br>
			<button id="submit-button">Submit
			</button>
			<div id="output"></div>
