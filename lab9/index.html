		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The Challenge of this lab is to experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>At first my button wasn't showing up, but I realized that I did not have a div with the proper id in my html.
				I also had trouble changing the size of the text, because for some reason style.fontsize did not work.
				Instead, we did style.font and changed the font itself as well. </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<div id="output"></div>
			<div id ="div_1"></div>
		</main>
