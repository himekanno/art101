		<h1>Challenge</h1>
			<p> Our intitial challenges were coming up with tasks to pseudocode. For baking
				cookies, it was strange to break down the task into individual actions. We had to rethink
				how one would describe a recipe. </p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p> Our main issue with the hangman game was figuring out how to word the steps
				the steps the computer needed to take, instead of the player. </p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
			<p><h2>Task1</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Look at the recipe</li>
					<li>Collect ingredients</li>
					<li>Select required baking tools</li>
					<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
					<li>Mix dry ingredients in the first bowl</li>
					<li>Set aside that bowl</li>
					<li>Mix butter and sugar in a second bowl</li>
					<li>Add eggs and vanilla extract</li>
					<li>Beat until it has a fluffy consistency</li>
					<li>Mix in chocolate chips</li>
					<li>Mix ingredients in the first bowl with the ingredients in the
						 second bowl until well combined</li>
					<li>Roll ball of cookie dough</li>
					<li>Place rolled dough ball on the cookie sheet</li>
					<li>Repeat steps 12 and 13 until the dough runs out</li>
					<li>Put the sheet in the oven</li>
					<li>Bake in the oven until cookies turn golden brown</li>
					<li>Take out the pan with cookies</li>
					<li>Leave cookies on the sheet for 2 minutes</li>
					<li>Place cookies on the cooling rack for 5 minutes</li>
					<li>Eat cookies</li>
				</ol></p>
			<p>This is an outline for how to make a chocolate chip cookie.</p>
			<h2>Task 3</h2>
				<pre>
					//Display categories
					//Accept user input
					    //Generate random word from category
					//Print board for each round
					  //Print letters
					    //Print border around each letter
					  //Print space for number of letters in generated word
					  //Print "lives" counter
					    //start with ten lives
					//Accept user input
					  //Compare input to answer
					  //Check for match
					    //If “yes”, display chosen letter in correct space
					      //Check for win condition
					        //If “yes”, display “You Win!”
					          //Restart round
					        //If “no” continue to accept input
					    //If “no”, take one life
					      //Display lives number minus one
					        //If lives counter reaches zero, display “You Lose”
					          //Restart round
				</pre>
			<p>This is the pseudocode for a hangman game that we have made into Javascript comments.</p>
