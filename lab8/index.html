		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The challenge of this lab is to work with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>At first nothing was showing up on the console and I had trouble setting up the functions, but my partner helped me fix it. We also got stuck on bonus task 2 but we were able to do bonus tasks 1,3, and 4.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Check JavaScript console to view results.</p>
